# `spo_msu1_v6.ips` — MSU-1 Audio Patch

> This patch was originally authored by **Kurrono** and published at
> [zeldix.net/t1951-super-punch-out](https://www.zeldix.net/t1951-super-punch-out).
> This document exists for update, preservation and compatibility purposes —
> to record what the patch does, how it interacts with Special Edition, and
> what is needed to make full use of it.
>
> `patches/standalone/spo_msu1_v6.ips` is a fixed version of the original v5
> with three corrections applied:
> 1. **Loop-flag bug fix** — three non-looping tracks (Win `$60`, Opponent Down
>    `$63`, Circuit Clear `$6F`) were missing from the stub's hardcoded
>    no-loop list and would incorrectly loop. The fix adds the three missing
>    `CMP/BEQ` pairs, growing the stub from 114B to 126B.
> 2. **`BNE spcFallback` offset fix** — inserting 12 bytes into the loop-flag
>    block shifted `spcFallback` by +12, but the branch offset was not updated.
>    Without this fix, the track-missing SPC fallback jumps to mid-function
>    garbage code and deadlocks, making the patch non-functional on any setup
>    without PCM files (including plain vanilla SNES).
> 3. **Checksum correction** — the original release had an incorrect SNES
>    header checksum at `0x7FDC`. Now computed correctly per the SNES ROM
>    header spec for non-power-of-2 ROMs: the 2MB base is summed normally,
>    and the 512KB remainder is repeated 4× (to match the 2MB base size)
>    before being summed and added. Reference:
>    [SnesLab — SNES ROM Header](https://sneslab.net/wiki/SNES_ROM_Header).
>
> No other bytes were changed.

## What it does

Hooks the game's SPC700 music-trigger routine and redirects playback through
the **MSU-1** co-processor when MSU-1 hardware is present. MSU-1 is a custom
SNES co-processor specification (by Near/byuu) that allows a ROM to stream
CD-quality 44.1 kHz stereo PCM audio, replacing the game's native SPC700
music entirely. If MSU-1 hardware is not detected at runtime, the patch falls
back to the original SPC700 audio transparently — vanilla music plays normally.

The patch does **not** include PCM audio files. Those must be sourced from
the original thread at [zeldix.net/t1951-super-punch-out](https://www.zeldix.net/t1951-super-punch-out),
which contains links to the PCM pack.

## Hardware and software requirements

| Platform | Support |
|---|---|
| Emulators (Mesen, bsnes, Snes9x 1.60+) | ✅ MSU-1 supported natively |
| MiSTer FPGA | ✅ MSU-1 supported |
| Real SNES + repro cart (no MSU-1) | ✅ SPC fallback plays vanilla audio |
| Real SNES + SD2SNES / FXPak Pro | ✅ MSU-1 supported via firmware |

**Note on real hardware:** the MSU-1 stub lives at SNES `$40:8000`
(file `0x200000`). The patch expands the ROM from 2MB to 2.5MB to
accommodate the stub and its zero-fill padding. On a repro cart the stub
bytes are burned onto the chip at that address and execute correctly — the
stub checks `$2002` for the MSU-1 signature and falls back to SPC audio if
it is not present. A repro cart on a standard SNES without MSU-1 hardware
will play vanilla SPC audio normally. An MSU-1 patched rom on SD2SNES / FXPak Pro
with MSU-1 firmware will play the PCM audio. The patch is real-hardware
compatible on any cart that holds the full 2.5 MB ROM image.

## Patch records

4 real records (the remainder are zero-fill padding):

| File offset | Size | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `0x00EC6D` | 4 B | Hook: `JSL $40:8000` — replaces the music-trigger call at SNES `$01:EC6D` |
| `0x044C0C` | 3 B | Hook: `JSL $40:8070` — mutes the demo/intro at SNES `$08:CC0C` (updated from `$40:8064` to match stub's new size) |
| `0x200000` | 126 B | MSU-1 stub at SNES `$40:8000` (114B original + 12B loop-flag fix) |
| `0x20007E–0x27FFFF` | ~512 KB | Zero-fill — pads the file so the IPS patcher can write the stub at `0x200000`; contains no executable or data content |
| `0x007FDC` | 4 B | SNES header checksum |

**Loop flags:** the stub marks these tracks as non-looping: 96 (Win), 97 (Lose), 98 (Player Down), 99 (Opponent Down), 108 (Title), 111 (Circuit Clear), 112 (Staff Roll), 113 (Press Start Jingle). All other tracks loop. Tracks 96, 99, and 111 were incorrectly looping in the original v5 — this is the fix.

## Compatibility with Special Edition v1.8

`spo_msu1_v6.ips` is **byte-disjoint** with every patch in this repository.
Zero conflicts with all SE standalone
patches and with `spo_special_edition_v1.8.ips` (excluding the SNES header
checksum at `0x7FDC`, which every standalone patch updates independently).

The MSU-1 hooks are at `0x00EC6D` and `0x044C0C` — neither touched by any SE
patch. The stub at `0x200000` is beyond the ROM's 2MB content range and
unreachable by any SE patch.

**Recommended apply order:**
```
vanilla → spo_special_edition_v1.8.ips → spo_msu1_v6.ips
```
Applied last, the MSU-1 patch stamps the final checksum. The result is a
valid, checksum-correct ROM.

---

## Setup

> The following instructions are adapted from the original documentation by Kurrono.

### Requirements

- Non-headered US ROM (`Super Punch-Out!! (U).sfc`). If your file has a `.smc`
  extension it likely has a 512-byte header and must be de-headered first.
- PCM audio files (sourced separately — see original thread).
- An MSU-1 capable emulator or flash cart (see hardware table above).

### Step 1 — Patch the ROM

Apply `spo_msu1_v6.ips` to the vanilla non-headered US ROM.

If stacking with Special Edition, apply in this order:

```
vanilla → spo_special_edition_v1.8.ips → spo_msu1_v6.ips
```

### Step 2 — Name the ROM

The patched ROM can be named anything, but **the PCM files and `.msu` marker
file must share the same base name as the ROM**. The PCM pack distributed by
Kurrono uses the base name `spo_msu1`, so if you are using those files rename
the ROM to `spo_msu1.sfc`. If you are providing your own PCM files, any name
works as long as ROM and PCMs match.

### Step 3 — Assemble the folder

Create a folder and place all of the following inside it:

```
spo_msu1.sfc          ← patched ROM (from steps 1 and 2)
spo_msu1.msu          ← empty marker file (not included; create an empty file with this name)
spo_msu1-96.pcm       ← Win
spo_msu1-97.pcm       ← Lose
spo_msu1-98.pcm       ← Player Down
... (all PCM files)
```

### Step 4 — Play

Launch `spo_msu1.sfc` in your emulator. For **higan**, import the ROM first,
then navigate to `%USERPROFILE%\Emulation\Super Famicom\spo_msu1.sfc\` and
copy an empty `spo_msu1.msu` and all PCM files into that folder.

---

## Compatibility

- **Apply on top of**: original `Super Punch-Out!! (USA).sfc` ROM (MD5 `97fe7d7d2a1017f8480e60a365a373f0`)
- **Conflicts with**: nothing in this repo
- **Cheat-code compatibility**: unaffected
