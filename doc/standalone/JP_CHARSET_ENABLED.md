# `spo_jp_charset_enabled.ips` — Summary

Makes the Japanese character set L/R-cycling always active on the name-entry screen, with no hidden button combo required. The screen still opens on the Western set by default — players who don't want Japanese characters won't notice any change. L and R cycle through three sets (Japanese-1, Japanese-2, Western), exactly like the Japanese version of the game.

## What it does

The original US/EUR ROM has a hidden mode where L/R cycles between three character sets, activated by holding a specific button combo (X+A or Start+X+A) at the New Game cursor. The Japanese version has this mode on by default. This patch removes the gate so the cycling is always available.

## Patch records

3 records, 3 bytes total (plus the SNES header checksum) — all single-byte tweaks at SNES `$01:DF83-DF95` (file `0xDF83-0xDF95`):

| File offset | Old | New | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0xDF83` | `F0` (BEQ) | `80` (BRA) | Always take the Japanese-mode-enabled branch |
| `0xDF92` | `9C` | `B7` | `JSR $D79C` → `JSR $D7B7` — load full Western UI tiles instead of just swapping the Japanese set (avoids corrupted tilemap on US ROM) |
| `0xDF95` | `00` | `02` | Initial `$1F = $02` (Western set index, matches the `$D7B7` load) |

## Free space consumed

None. All three records are in-place edits.

## Patch in asm form

```asm
; spo_jp_charset_enabled
; Makes the Japanese character set L/R-cycling always active in name entry,
; opening on the Western set by default. Three single-byte tweaks.

org $01DF83
    BRA +$0B        ; was: BEQ +$0B — always take the JP-mode-enabled branch

org $01DF92
    db $B7          ; was: $9C — redirect JSR from $D79C to $D7B7
                    ; $D7B7 loads full Western UI tiles (avoids corrupted tilemap
                    ; on US ROM where Japanese-set tiles aren't pre-loaded)

org $01DF95
    db $02          ; was: $00 — initial charset index = 2 (Western), matching $D7B7
```

(Plus the standard 4-byte SNES header checksum update at file `0x7FDC`.)

For the byte-by-byte explanation of the second tweak (why we redirect to `JSR $D7B7` instead of just enabling the Japanese path), see the `spo_jp_charset_enabled.ips` entry in [doc/TECHNICAL.md § 6](../TECHNICAL.md).
