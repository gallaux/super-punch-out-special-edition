# Super Punch-Out!! Special Edition — Technical Reference

This document covers the full reverse-engineering and implementation details behind the patches described in [README.md](../README.md). It is intended for ROM hackers, the technically curious, and anyone who wants to continue this work.

**Reference:** all `CODE_*`, `DATA_*`, `UNK_*` labels and `%InsertGarbageData` regions referenced in this document follow the conventions of [**Yoshifanatic1's Super Punch-Out!! Disassembly**](https://github.com/Yoshifanatic1/Super-Punch-Out-Disassembly), which has been an invaluable reference throughout the development of this hack.

The recommended distribution is the bundled [`spo_special_edition_v1.6.ips`](../patches/spo_special_edition_v1.6.ips), which stacks every patch in this repo.
The core patch it builds on is [`spo_versus_hack.ips`](../patches/standalone/spo_versus_hack.ips) — that's what adds VERSUS MODE, lets either controller pick on the opponent-select screen, and disables the Special Circuit security checksum lock; everything else (alt glove colors, profile stat fixes, Super Macho Man typo fix, tutorial-demo typo fix, title-screen tweaks, JP charset, credits entry) layers on top as standalone patches.

**Compatibility guarantee:** all 10 standalone patches in this repo are byte-level compatible with one another. They can be applied in any order on top of a fresh `spo.sfc` and the result is identical to the bundled `spo_special_edition_v1.6.ips`. The only overlap between any two standalones is at file `0x003C23` (the Special Circuit lock-bypass byte), which both `spo_versus_hack.ips` and `spo_disable_security_checksum.ips` write with the same value — applying both is a harmless no-op double-write.

## 1. ROM structure

**Format:** LoROM (32 KB banks mapped at SNES $8000–$FFFF).

**File offset formula:**
```
file_offset = bank × 0x8000 + (SNES_addr − 0x8000)
```

Examples:
```
SNES $01:B194 → file 0x0B194
SNES $01:E16F → file 0x0E16F
SNES $0D:A3DA → file 0x6A3DA
SNES $0D:FA69 → file 0x6FA69
SNES $02:8408 → file 0x10408
```

**Direct Page register** is set to `$0C00` by `CODE_01B0F0` at title-screen entry and maintained throughout. All DP-relative references (e.g. `$10`, `$11`, `$23`) resolve to WRAM `$0C10`, `$0C11`, `$0C23`, etc.

**Original ROM MD5:** `97fe7d7d2a1017f8480e60a365a373f0`

## 2. The secret 2-player mode

The game contains a dormant 2-player mode. The P2 boss-control flag lives at WRAM `$0030`; when it equals `$08`, Controller 2 drives the opponent. The code that sets this flag lives at SNES `$81:80CC`:

```asm
$81:80CC  LDA $0607      ; game mode flag
          CMP #$02       ; is this a VERSUS session?
          BNE +$10       ; skip if not
          ...
$81:80D4  BNE +$99       ; skip flag-set if button combo not held
$81:80D6  LDA #$08
          STA <$30       ; set P2 boss-control flag
          LDA #$80
          STA <$3D       ; set supplemental flag
```

The `BNE +$99` at `$81:80D4` (file `0x80D4`) nearly always branches past the flag-set because it guards against a specific button combination on the character-info screen. The Versus route in this hack bypasses the info screen entirely, so without a fix this code never runs and the CPU controls both fighters.

The Game Genie code `DD62-DF00` and GameShark code `180D5:00` both fix this by zeroing the branch offset at `$81:80D4`. This hack instead replaces the `JSL $0E:80CA` call just before this block (`$01:80CA`, file `0x080CA`) with a `JSL` to a stub at `$0D:FC4C` that sets `$30=$08` and `$3D=$80` unconditionally when `$0607=$03` (VERSUS), bypassing the button-combo guard entirely. For `$0607=$02` (the original secret button-combo mode), the stub falls through to the original path so the hidden combo continues to work as before.

**Discovery:** this mechanic was first publicly documented in 2022.

---

## 3. Title screen state machine

Entry point: `CODE_01B0F0` (file `0xB0F0`) — sets Direct Page = `$0C00`.

The machine dispatches on two nested state variables, `$01` and `$03`, via indexed indirect jump tables:

```
CODE_01B12D: LDX $01 → JMP (DATA_01B132, X)
  $01=0 → CODE_01B138: LDX $03 → JMP (DATA_01B13D, X)
    $03=$00 → CODE_01B14D   menu init
    $03=$0A → CODE_01B24C   menu interaction (cursor lives here)
    $03=$0C → CODE_01B389   circuit select
    $03=$0E → CODE_01B5C3   data clear
  $01=2 → CODE_01B8A3       post-confirm (new game / circuit entry)
  $01=4 → CODE_01BB61       Mode Select + Championship sub-machine
```

**Interactive menu loop** (`CODE_01DFB4`, state `$03=$0A`, sub-state `$05=2`): calls `CODE_01D8F7` for button input, then dispatches:

```
A-button → CODE_01E0A3
DPad     → CODE_01E123 → up/down/left/right handlers
Start    → CODE_01E005
```

**Cursor position encoding:** the cursor is a 16-bit word stored across DP+`$10` (X, lo byte) and DP+`$11` (Y, hi byte). The A-button handler reads `LDX $10` (16-bit) and compares it against known cursor values:

| Value  | Menu item      |
|--------|----------------|
| `$BF80`| NEW GAME       |
| `$BF90`| CONTINUE       |
| `$AFA0`| DATA CLEAR     |
| `$BFB0`| circuit select |

## 4. Mode Select architecture

### Design decision: duplicating Time Attack rather than using the secret VS menu

The game contains a dormant VS menu that is never reachable through normal play (`CODE_00B29C` and surrounding code). Routing Versus through it was considered and rejected for two reasons:

1. **Not part of the normal game loop.** The secret VS menu sits outside the state machine that governs the title screen and Mode Select. Entering it from Mode Select context causes a corrupt first frame because the VRAM state, CGRAM palette, and engine sub-states expected by that code are never set up by the normal flow. Recovering to a clean game loop after the match also proved unreliable through this path.

2. **The Time Attack path is clean and already correct.** The Time Attack opponent-select screen is a fully functional, menu-driven character picker that sits squarely inside the normal game-state machine. By duplicating its screen descriptor and routing Versus through the same state machine path (with `$0607=$03` as a mode flag), Versus gets a working opponent-select screen, clean back-out navigation, and a correct post-match return with no extra work.

The result is that Versus mode reuses the Time Attack infrastructure throughout, differentiated only by the `$0607` flag. The conditional stubs (trampoline 1, trampoline 2, the header stub at `$8018`, the back-out clear stub) all key off this flag to give Versus its own behavior while leaving Time Attack completely unchanged.

**Post-match behavior:** when a Versus match ends, the game returns to the intro cutscene that plays before the title screen — the same behavior observed with the original secret VS mode. This is a consequence of sharing the Time Attack state machine, which routes back to the top-level game loop from that point. Match times are not recorded to Time Attack records.

Reached via `$01=4`, `$03=2`. The sub-machine dispatches on `$05` via `DATA_01BC76`:

```
$05=0 → $BC82   init (sets disable flags, renders layout)
$05=4 → $BE8C   interactive input handler
$05=8 → $C905   confirm dispatch (maps cursor index → action)
```

### Layout system

Screen text is driven by a two-level table chain rooted at `DATA_0DA3DA` (file `0x6A3DA`). Entry 2 of that table is a bank-relative pointer to the Mode Select layout sub-table.

**Layout sub-table record format** (4 bytes each):
```
[text_idx][attr][WRAM_lo][WRAM_hi]
```
- `text_idx`: index into `DATA_0DA332` (text string pointer table)
- `attr`: `$1C` = selectable (highlight when cursor is on it), `$20` = always visible
- `WRAM lo/hi`: target address in the WRAM tilemap buffer

Terminator: `$00`.

**Tilemap address formula:**
```
WRAM_addr = $5000 + row × $40 + col × 2
```

### Cursor highlight system

Two independent systems — both must be consistent:

**System 1 — highlight renderer** (`CODE_01CC79`): loops `$14 + 1` times (where `$14` = item count − 1). For each item, reads the disable flag at DP+`$20+x`; if zero, renders the highlight tile at the current D0 position (advances by `$0100` per item). Purely visual.

**System 2 — interactive cursor** (`CODE_01DDD8` onward): tracks cursor position in DP+`$10`/`$11`, updates OAM sprite position, handles DPad input.

### Confirm dispatch — `CODE_01C905`

After the player confirms a selection, `$07E3` holds the 0-based cursor item index. `CODE_01C905` maps it to a state transition:

Original (4-item menu):
```
$07E3=0 → CHAMPIONSHIP  (STZ $03/$05; JMP $C752 → INC $01×2)
$07E3=1 → TIME ATTACK   (STA $0607=#$01; STZ $05; JMP $C74C → INC $03×2)
$07E3=2 → RECORDS VIEW  (LDA #$04; STA $03; BRA $C951)
$07E3=3 → BUTTON SETTINGS (LDA #$06; STA $03; BRA $C951)
```

Our patch inserts a JMP at `$C90E` to redirect all indices ≥ 1 through a 5-item stub in free space.

---

## 5. Versus Hack — patch-by-patch breakdown

All records are applied to the original unmodified ROM. Records are listed in file-offset order. Every patch in this repository includes a checksum record at file `0x7FDC` (2-4 bytes, depending on which header complement/checksum bytes change) that updates the SNES header so the patched ROM passes the hardware integrity check.

---

### [1] File `0x003C23` — Special Circuit lock bypass (2 bytes)

```
Old: 05 D5   ORA $D5
New: A9 00   LDA #$00
```

The World Circuit completion checksum prevents the Special Circuit from unlocking when using save states, emulators (SNES Classic, Switch NSO), or patched ROMs. At SNES `$00:BC23`, this routine stores its result to SRAM `$700080` (Special Circuit lock flag). Replacing `ORA $D5` with `LDA #$00` disables that checksum check — A is forced to zero before the store, so the lock flag is always written as unlocked regardless of checksum result.

---

### [2] File `0x008018` — Conditional VERSUS/TIME ATTACK header stub (18 bytes)

```asm
48           PHA               ; save Y-arg (A = TYA result = $0C or $0E)
AD 07 06     LDA $0607         ; read mode flag
C9 03        CMP #$03          ; VERSUS?
F0 04        BEQ +4            ; branch BEFORE PLA (avoids PLA clobbering Z flag)
68           PLA               ; non-VERSUS: restore Y-arg
4C FC D1     JMP $D1FC         ; tail-call descriptor renderer
68           PLA               ; VERSUS: restore Y-arg
A9 A4        LDA #$A4          ; override descriptor index to VERSUS descriptor
4C FC D1     JMP $D1FC         ; tail-call renderer
```

Called from `CODE_01BD0D` (file `0x0BD0F`), which originally called `JSR $D1FC` directly. Redirected to `JSR $8018`.

**Critical note:** PLA on SNES updates the N and Z processor flags from the pulled value — not from the preceding CMP. The BEQ must come before PLA, or it always sees Z=0 (since the pulled value `$0C`/`$0E` is always nonzero). The BEQ is correctly placed before PLA for this reason.

This stub sits in the dead-loop jump-table slots at `$8018`/`$801B`/`$801E` (self-referencing JMP dead loops, never called) plus 9 bytes of confirmed free space at `$8021–$8029`.

---

### [3] File `0x080CA` — P2 control hook: JSL to FC4C dispatch stub (12 bytes)

```
Old: C9 02 D0 A1 AD AB 00 2D AF 00 10 99
New: 22 4C FC 0D D0 03 4C DE 80 4C 6F 80
```

Replaces the original `CMP #$02; BNE $806F; LDA $00AB; AND $00AF; BPL $806F` block at SNES `$81:80CA` with:

```asm
JSL $0D:FC4C   ; P2 control dispatch stub (handles all cases)
BNE +3         ; A≠0 on return: skip to $80D3 (combo-not-held path)
JMP $80DE      ; flag was set → continue normally
JMP $806F      ; not set → skip
```

The new stub at `$0D:FC4C` handles both the VERSUS path and the original secret-mode button-combo path cleanly. See record [31].

---

### [4] File `0x008457` — Trampoline 1: conditional TA disable (12 bytes)

```asm
D0 09        BNE +9     ; if $700010,X ≠ 0 (has progress): skip to RTS
AD 07 06     LDA $0607
C9 03        CMP #$03
F0 02        BEQ +2     ; if VERSUS: skip to RTS (leave TA enabled)
E6 22        INC $22    ; TA + no progress: disable TIME ATTACK
60           RTS
```

Called via `JSR $8457` at `$01:BBE2` (replaces the original `BNE +02; INC $22` sequence). Ensures TIME ATTACK is only greyed out when there is no Championship progress AND we are not currently in VERSUS mode (since entering Versus then backing out would otherwise leave `$22=0`, making TA appear available even on a fresh save).

---

### [5] File `0x008463` — Back-out clear stub (6 bytes)

```asm
9C 07 06     STZ $0607   ; clear mode flag on back-out
4C 66 C7     JMP $C766   ; continue to original epilog
```

When the player backs out of opponent select, `BEEE: JMP $C766` is redirected here first. Without this, `$0607` stays `=$03` (VERSUS) after back-out, causing the conditional trampoline to skip `INC $22` on re-entry — making TIME ATTACK spuriously appear available on fresh saves and then deadlocking when selected.

---

### [6] File `0x00BB93` — Item count: 4 → 5 (1 byte)

```
Old: 03   LDX #$0003
New: 04   LDX #$0004
```

At SNES `$01:BB93`, sets `$14 = 4` (5 items, 0-indexed) for the highlight-cursor loop. The original rendered only 4 items (CHAMPIONSHIP through BUTTON SETTINGS).

---

### [7] File `0x00BB99` — Highlight base address (1 byte)

```
Old: 02   LDX #$024C   ($47 = $024C → D0 starts at $5000+$024C+2 = row 9)
New: 01   LDX #$014C   ($47 = $014C → D0 starts at row 5)
```

Shifts the cursor-highlight starting position up by 4 rows to match CHAMPIONSHIP's new position.

---

### [8] Files `0x00BBA3`, `0x00BBA7`, `0x00BBB3–BBB4` — Disable flag init (4 bytes)

These four patches rewrite the `LDX/STX` pairs that initialise items' `$20–$24` disable flags at menu init, for both the has-save and new-game paths. Net effect:

| Item | No progress | Has progress |
|---|---|---|
| CHAMPIONSHIP | enabled | enabled |
| VERSUS | enabled | enabled |
| TIME ATTACK | disabled | enabled |
| RECORDS VIEW | disabled | enabled |
| BUTTON SETTINGS | enabled | enabled |

---

### [9] File `0x00BBB3` + `0x00BBE2–BBF2` — Progress gate rewrite (17 bytes)

Replaces the original conditional `INC`/`STZ` block (`$01:BBE2–BBF2`) with:

```asm
JSR $8457      ; trampoline 1 — disables TIME ATTACK only when
               ;   no progress AND not in VERSUS mode
NOP            ; (padding)
STZ $24        ; BUTTON SETTINGS always enabled (unconditional)
LDA $700010,X  ; read Minor Championship progress flag
BEQ +3         ; no progress: skip STZ $23
STZ $23        ; enable RECORDS VIEW only with progress
NOP
NOP
NOP
```

This gives the correct two-state unlock behavior based on `$700010,X` (the SRAM Minor Circuit progress flag).

---

### [9b] Files `0x00BBC7`, `0x00BBD0`, `0x00BBD3` — Decoration tilemap + arrow positions for 5-item layout (6 bytes)

Three 2-byte adjustments to header decoration and arrow sprite positions to match the new 5-item Mode Select layout (rows 5/9/13/17/21 instead of the original 9/13/17/21):

| File offset | Old | New | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x00BBC7` | `14 59` | `54 58` | MENU/SELECT decoration tilemap addr `$5994` → `$5854` (visual row 2) |
| `0x00BBD0` | `10 01` | `50 00` | Left arrow position `$0110` → `$0050` |
| `0x00BBD3` | `2E 01` | `6E 00` | Right arrow position `$012E` → `$006E` |

---

### [10] File `0x00BC1D` — OAM cursor Y base (1 byte)

```
Old: 47   LDX #$472C ($53 = $47)
New: 27   LDX #$272C ($53 = $27)
```

OAM cursor Y formula: `Y = item_index × $20 + $53 + 1`. Adjusting `$53` from `$47` to `$27` shifts the cursor sprite 32 px up to align with CHAMPIONSHIP at its new row 5 position.

---

### [11] File `0x00BCAA` — Circuit count: JSR $D641 → JSR $FFD3 (2 bytes)

Redirects the JSR that reads available circuit count from SRAM to our trampoline 2.

---

### [12] File `0x00BD0F` — Header renderer: JSR $D1FC → JSR $8018 (2 bytes)

Redirects the opponent-select screen descriptor renderer call to our conditional stub.

---

### [13] File `0x00BEEF` — Back-out redirect: JMP $C766 → JMP $8463 (2 bytes)

Redirects the back-out button handler in opponent select to our clear stub.

---

### [14] File `0x00C90E` — Mode Select confirm: JMP to dispatch stub (3 bytes)

```
Old: C9 01 F0   CMP #$01; BEQ ...  (top of 4-item chain)
New: 4C B0 FF   JMP $FFB0
```

At SNES `$01:C90E`, reached after `$07E3=0` (CHAMPIONSHIP) has already been handled by `BEQ $C91C` at `$C90C`. Hands A (= `$07E3`, item index 1+) to our 5-item stub in bank `$01` free space. This is the only confirm site that needs hooking — the post-Start dispatcher at `$01:C8E9` must **not** be patched (see [section 9](#9-key-addresses-quick-reference)).

---

### [15] File `0x00FFB0` — 5-item Mode Select dispatch stub (19 bytes, SNES `$01:FFB0`)

```asm
C9 01        CMP #$01
F0 15        BEQ +$15   ; → $FFC9 (VERSUS handler — record [17])
C9 02        CMP #$02
F0 0B        BEQ +$0B   ; → $FFC3 (TIME ATTACK trampoline — record [16])
C9 03        CMP #$03
F0 0A        BEQ +$0A   ; → $FFC6 (RECORDS VIEW trampoline — record [16])
A9 06        LDA #$06    ; BUTTON SETTINGS fall-through
85 03        STA $03
4C 51 C9     JMP $C951   ; → STZ $05/$07; PLB; RTL
```

Occupies `$FFB0–$FFC2`. The trampolines and handlers that follow at `$FFC3` are packed contiguously immediately after — Versus routes through the Time Attack state machine (see Section 4) rather than directly launching the secret VS menu, so no separate VS-launcher path is needed.

---

### [16] File `0x00FFC3` — TIME ATTACK + RECORDS VIEW trampolines (6 bytes)

```asm
; $FFC3 — TIME ATTACK:
4C 26 C9     JMP $C926   ; STA $0607=#$01; STZ $05; JMP $C74C
; $FFC6 — RECORDS VIEW:
4C 30 C9     JMP $C930   ; LDA #$04; STA $03; BRA $C951
```

---

### [17] File `0x00FFC9` — VERSUS handler (10 bytes, SNES `$01:FFC9`)

```asm
A9 03        LDA #$03
8D 07 06     STA $0607   ; mode flag = VERSUS
64 05        STZ $05
4C 4C C7     JMP $C74C   ; INC $03 ×2; PLB; RTL
```

This is the actual VERSUS entry reached by the `BEQ +$15` at `$FFB2`. Structurally identical to the original TIME ATTACK dispatch (`STA $0607=#$01; STZ $05; JMP $C74C`) but with `$0607=$03` so the conditional stubs (header at `$8018`, trampolines, table-hide stubs) all key off the Versus path while reusing the Time Attack state machine.

---

### [18] File `0x00FFD3` — Trampoline 2: conditional circuit count (13 bytes, SNES `$01:FFD3`)

```asm
AD 07 06     LDA $0607
C9 03        CMP #$03
F0 03        BEQ +3      ; if VERSUS: skip to LDA #$04
4C 41 D6     JMP $D641   ; TA: tail-call SRAM circuit-count reader (RTS returns to caller)
A9 04        LDA #$04    ; VERSUS: force 4 circuits (all characters always available)
60           RTS
```

Trampoline 2's RTS sits at `$FFDF`. The 4 bytes at `$FFE0–$FFE3` are **free** (immediately before the interrupt vectors).

---

### [19] File `0x06A38C` — DA332[`$2D`] pointer redirect (2 bytes)

```
Old: (prototype fighter name garbage)
New: 03 FB   → SNES $FB03
```

Repurposes text index `$2D` to point to the new "PLAYER 2" tile data.

---

### [20] File `0x06A3A0` — DA332[`$37`] pointer redirect (2 bytes)

```
Old: B5 AC   → original DA332[$37] entry (unrelated game text — index $37 was unused for menus)
New: C3 FA   → "VERSUS" tile data at $FAC3
```

DA332 index `$37` is repurposed by this hack as the VERSUS tile-string slot, since it pointed at non-menu data in the original ROM.

---

### [21] File `0x06A3DE` — DA3DA entry 2 pointer (2 bytes)

```
Old: 6A AD   → original Mode Select layout sub-table at $AD6A
New: 86 FA   → new layout sub-table at $FA86
```

---

### [22] File `0x06A47E` — DA3DA byte-offset `$A4` pointer (2 bytes)

```
Old: 88 51   → original pointer (unused/garbage in original ROM — entry was not referenced)
New: CA FA   → current 12-record VERSUS descriptor at $FACA
```

DA3DA byte-offset `$A4` (entry index 82) is repurposed by this hack to point at the new VERSUS opponent-select descriptor. The original pointer led to garbage; nothing in the unmodified game routed through it.

---

### [23] File `0x06FA86` — New Mode Select layout sub-table (61 bytes)

```
0D 1C 4E 51   CHAMPIONSHIP  row 5  col 7   ($514E)

### [25] File `0x06FACA` — 12-record VERSUS opponent-select descriptor (49 bytes)

Full descriptor for the VERSUS opponent-select screen (used when `$0607=$03`). Contains all four circuit rows (Special, World, Major, Minor), the VERSUS MODE header at row 2, and the `< PLAYER 2 SELECT >` row.

Key records:

### Versus opponent-select table-hide (records [27]-[30])

The opponent-select screen normally shows a BEST TIME / YOUR BEST table populated from the Time Attack save data. On Versus that table is meaningless. The following four patch records blank that table region (a 30×7 tile rectangle, both BG layers) when entering from Versus, so the screen looks like a clean opponent picker. The blanking is gated on `$0607 == $03` so Time Attack's score table renders normally.

```
Old: 22 DD F3 0E   JSL $0E:F3DD
New: 22 62 FB 0D   JSL $0D:FB62
```

Replaces the existing `JSL $0E:F3DD` near the end of the opponent-select init (just before the final DMA upload at `$01:B3BF`). The new target is a stub at `$0D:FB62` which calls `JSL $0E:F3DD` itself (preserving exact original behavior), then conditionally blanks the BEST TIME / YOUR BEST table region when `$0607 == $03` (Versus mode). See [29].

```

Replaces the last two instructions of `CODE_01BE9B` (the char-switch render path that runs when `$0C80 == $86`). The stub at `$0D:FB98` inlines `D7BC`'s body (an 8-byte DMA list copy from `DATA_01D7D2` to `$0387`+ — required for both modes), then conditionally blanks BG3 only when `$0607 == $03`. The two NOPs after the JSL fall harmlessly through to `CODE_01BECE`. See [30].

Blanks a 30-col × 7-row rectangle (cols 1-30, rows 18-24) on both BG1 and BG3 by writing `$0000` (tile 0, palette 0 — universally transparent). BG3 tilemap is at WRAM `$5800-$5FFF`, exactly `$0800` above BG1 at `$5000`, so a single inner loop writes both layers without extra arithmetic.

Inlines `CODE_01D7BC`'s body (DMA list setup at `$0387` — needed every char-switch in both modes), then conditionally blanks BG3 only when `$0607 == $03`. BG1 doesn't need re-blanking because the char-switch render path doesn't touch it. The `LDA.l $01:D7D2,x` long-indexed read accesses the bank-$01 lookup table directly, avoiding the need for a bank-$01 trampoline.

**Why the cross-bank inlining:** `CODE_01BE9B` runs in bank `$01`, and the natural fix would be a bank-$01 trampoline that does `JSR $D7BC` + blank + `JMP $BECE`. But at the time records [27]–[30] were written, bank `$01` had zero confirmed-free bytes — the credits no-record fix stub at `$01:FEC2` had not yet been added. Inlining `D7BC`'s 14 bytes inside our bank-$0D stub avoids needing any bank-$01 space.

6B           RTL            ; combo not held, return A≠0
;-- VERSUS path: unconditionally enable P2 control --
FC65:
A9 08        LDA #$08
85 30        STA $30        ; P2 boss-control flag = $08
A9 80        LDA #$80
85 3D        STA $3D        ; supplemental flag = $80
A9 00        LDA #$00
6B           RTL            ; return A=0 (flag set)
```

Called via `JSL $0D:FC4C` from the hook at `$01:80CA` (record [3]). When `$0607=$03` (VERSUS), sets `$30=$08` unconditionally — Controller 2 always controls the opponent. When `$0607=$02` (original secret button-combo mode), falls through to the original button-combo check logic at `$FC5A`, preserving the hidden VS mode's behavior unchanged. The return value convention (A=0 = flag was set, A≠0 = not set) lets the caller at `$01:80CA` branch on BNE to skip the follow-on path.

### [32] File `0x00C936` — Post-match epilog hook (6 bytes)

```

Replaces the 6-byte epilog at `$01:C936` (the Mode Select dispatch's `$05=8 / $44 ≠ 0` branch). The original code set `dp+$01=0, dp+$03=$0C` (circuit-select state) unconditionally. The stub at `$0D:FC72` replicates that behavior for non-VERSUS matches and falls cleanly back to the top-level loop for VERSUS without forcing the circuit-select state. See record [33].

64 01        STZ $01
A9 0C        LDA #$0C
85 03        STA $03       ; dp+$03 = $0C → circuit-select state
5C 3C C9 01  JML $01:C93C  ; continue original epilog

FC83:
64 01        STZ $01       ; clear level-1 state var
64 03        STZ $03       ; clear level-2 state var

5C 51 C9 01  JML $01:C951  ; PLB; RTL → returns to top-level loop
EA EA EA EA  NOP ×4        ; padding
```

For VERSUS, the stub zeroes the three dp state vars (`$01`, `$03`, `$05`) and JMLs to `$01:C951` (the standard `PLB; RTL` epilog) so the state machine returns cleanly without re-entering circuit select. The actual end-of-match routing — which mode-flag value to present to the shared post-match dispatcher at `$00:B205` — is handled separately at record [33b].

### [33b] File `0x031D9` + `0x06FD99` — Mode-flag rewrite hook (4 + 17 bytes)

After a match ends, the in-match runner `CODE_00B07D` falls through to its own post-match epilogue, which unconditionally reads `$0607` and dispatches via `CODE_00B205` (`CMP #$02; BCC $B219; BEQ $B202`). To route both `$0607=$02` (secret VS mode) and `$0607=$03` (our VERSUS) through that same `BEQ $B202 → JMP $008837` → intro-cutscene path **without modifying** `$B205` itself, we hook the `JSL $01:EC00` call that runs five instructions before the dispatcher and have the stub rewrite `$0607=$03` to `$02` before chaining to the original target. The dispatcher then sees `$02` and takes the secret-mode route.

**Hook** (4 bytes at file `0x031D9`, SNES `$00:B1D9`):

```
Old: 22 00 EC 01   JSL $01:EC00
New: 22 99 FD 0D   JSL $0D:FD99
```

**Stub** (17 bytes at `$0D:FD99`, file `0x6FD99`):

```asm
AD 07 06     LDA $0607
C9 03        CMP #$03
D0 05        BNE +$05      ; not VERSUS → skip rewrite
A9 02        LDA #$02
8D 07 06     STA $0607     ; impersonate secret-mode flag
;-- skip:
22 00 EC 01  JSL $01:EC00  ; tail-call the displaced original
6B           RTL
```

This keeps the shared dispatcher at `$00:B205` byte-identical to the original ROM. Secret VS mode (`$0607=$02`) takes the original `BEQ $B202 → intro` path; our VERSUS (`$0607=$03`) gets converted to `$02` one instruction before that check and rides the same path. Both modes converge on the intro cutscene and reset cleanly.

### [34] File `0x00BECE` + `0x06FC91` — P2-mirrors-P1 on Versus opponent-select (5 + 216 bytes)

On the VERSUS opponent-select screen only, Controller 2's D-pad / A / Start are merged into Controller 1's pressed-this-frame globals before the menu's input dispatch reads them — so either player can navigate and confirm. Gated on `$0607 == $03`, so the merge is skipped on Time Attack opponent-select (which shares the same runloop) and on every other screen; back-out and match-end both clear `$0607`, so the feature deactivates automatically.

**Part 1 — File `0x00BECE` (5 bytes): hook**

```
Old: 20 F7 D8 C9 09   JSR $D8F7; CMP #$09
New: 22 91 FC 0D EA   JSL $0D:FC91; NOP
```

The hook sits inside the opponent-select runloop body at `$01:BECE`, immediately before the per-frame button-index dispatch (`BEQ $BEFC` for D-pad, etc.). All five bytes of the original `JSR $D8F7; CMP #$09` are overwritten: the JSL invokes our stub (which performs the merge, calls an inlined copy of `D8F7`, and re-issues the `CMP #$09` before `RTL`), and the trailing `NOP` keeps the byte count unchanged so the downstream `BEQ $BEFC` lands at the same offset.

**P2 pressed-this-frame derivation:** the original game does not compute "P2 newly-pressed" anywhere — only P1 has dedicated globals (`$0092/$0093/$0095/$00A1`). The stub synthesizes it via `held XOR prev_held AND held`, using two unused WRAM bytes (`$00A6`/`$00A7`) as the prev-held shadow. When `$0607 ≠ $03` the shadow is zeroed so the next entry to Versus opponent-select starts fresh.

**Why inline `D8F7` instead of calling it:** the body at `$01:D8F7` ends in `RTS` (intra-bank return). Calling it from bank `$0D` via `JSL` would return to bank `$0D` correctly (`RTL` semantics) — but `D8F7` doesn't end in `RTL`. Calling it via `JML` with a faked far-return on the stack also fails because `RTS` is intra-bank: it would resume in whatever bank `JML` arrived in (bank `$01`), and bank `$01` has no free space for the post-poll completion code. The cleanest solution is to copy `D8F7`'s 123-byte body verbatim into bank `$0D` (it's bank-position-independent — every read/write uses absolute mode against `$0090–$00A3` with DBR=$00) and invoke it via `PEA + JMP` so its `RTS` lands inside the stub. The `CMP #$09` after `RTS` reproduces the displaced opcode so the caller's `BEQ $BEFC` branches off the correct flag.

**Locality of the feature:** because every other entry path to the opponent-select runloop also leaves `$0607` clear (Mode Select sets it just before transitioning to opponent-select; Time Attack uses `$0607=$01`), the gate `CMP #$03; BEQ` is sufficient to scope the merge to Versus only. Back-out clears `$0607` via the existing stub at `$01:8463` (record [5]); match-end is handled by records [32]/[33]/[33b].

## 6. Standalone patches — technical detail

Each standalone patch has a companion doc in `doc/standalone/` that includes the patch records, byte-for-byte effect descriptions, free-space inventory, compatibility notes, and a **patch in asm form** section with the full assembler overlay. This section documents the deeper technical context (rationale, data-structure background, layout reasoning, etc.); the standalone docs are the right place for machine-readable asm.

### [`spo_alt_glove_colors.ips`](../patches/standalone/spo_alt_glove_colors.ips)

**What it does:** Adds a runtime glove-color selector. Each opponent has a circuit-default color (Minor=vanilla green, Major=blue, World=red, Special=yellow, mirroring the per-circuit glove tones in Punch-Out!! Wii); the player can override via L/R/X/Y held during the pre-fight transition. The override applies only to the current match — the next fight reseeds from the opponent default. All player-glove animation states render in the chosen mode's hue: rest, the powered-up cycling animation, the knock-out-punch / rapid-punch frames, the portrait HUD (rest + both powered-up frames), the BG-tile renders for the victory pose / knockdown / get-up animations, and the player sprite on the ending credits screen.

The full byte-level breakdown (hook sites, stub assembly, color tables) lives in the standalone doc [doc/standalone/ALT_GLOVE_COLORS.md](standalone/ALT_GLOVE_COLORS.md). This section covers the deeper technical context: *why* this is a runtime patch instead of a ROM-data patch, the glove animation state machine, and the cross-bank-RTS trap the portrait hooks had to navigate.

**Why runtime, not ROM-data:** patching `Layer1_Contender.bin` directly produces the right rest color but bleeds into the post-match BEST TIME background (which reuses parts of the contender palette region) and corrupts opponent palettes (since the per-fighter palette tables overlap the same WRAM range). The runtime approach leaves all ROM palette data intact and writes per-mode colors directly into WRAM at fight init, scoped to the WRAM slots actually read by player-only animations.

**Glove animation state machine:** the player's gloves render through *two* systems with five distinct WRAM sources:

| State | Render system | WRAM target | Driven by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rest gloves | sprite OAM palette 0 c12-c15 | `$7E:0518-$051F` | written by Hook 1 trampoline at fight init (MVN 1) |
| Powered-up (cycling charged-up) | sprite OAM palette 0 c12-c15 (same slot) | `$7E:0518-$051F` | engine snapshots rest, writes powered-up colors during animation, restores rest after — `CODE_00DD43` writer is hooked to use a per-mode lookup |
| Knock-out-punch / rapid-punch | sprite OAM palette 3 c12-c15 | `$7E:0578-$057F` | `CODE_00DDAA` writer hooked for per-mode lookup; Hook 1 also pre-writes the chosen color into `$0578-$057F` (MVN 3) so the engine's snapshot/restore preserves it across attacks |
| Portrait HUD (rest + 2 powered-up frames) | sprite OAM palette 1 c12-c13 | `$7E:0538/$053A` | `CODE_00EC6E` is called from 4 sites; each is hooked, and the stubs frame-detect via the c12 word the engine just wrote |
| Victory pose / knockdown / get-up | BG layer 1 with BG palette 2 c12-c15 | `$7E:0458-$045F` | written by Hook 1 trampoline at fight init (MVN 2) |
| Ending credits screen (final stats / "THE END") | sprite OAM palette 4 c12-c15 | `$7E:0580-$058F` | Static ROM patch at file `0x05DF` (`DATA_008547` palette 4 c12-c15) — no runtime hook needed |

**The contender DMA + knock-out-punch snapshot/restore interaction:** at fight init, a DMA at `$00:97DF` copies `Layer1_Contender.bin` bytes into WRAM `$0540-$057F`. Bytes 56-63 of that file are vanilla glove green and land at `$0578-$057F` (sprite OAM palette 3 c12-c15). The engine's knock-out-punch state uses a snapshot/restore mechanism (`CODE_00DE01` snapshots `$0578-$057E` to DP `$22-$28` before attack frames; `CODE_00DDCC` restores after). Without intervention the snapshot captures vanilla green, the DDAA hook briefly writes our per-mode color during the attack, then the restore puts vanilla green back over our color — a visible green flash right after every knock-out-punch.

The fix is the third MVN in Hook 1: at fight init the trampoline overwrites `$0578-$057F` with the chosen mode's color *before* the engine ever runs the snapshot. The snapshot then captures our color, and the restore preserves it across attacks.

**Hook point: `$00:97E5`** (file `0x017E5`) — universal fight-init, inside `CODE_009762`. The original 6 bytes there (`A2 00 00 A0 E0 3E` = `LDX #$0000; LDY #$3EE0`) are replaced with `JSL $0D:FDD2 + 2×NOP`; the trampoline re-emits the displaced LDX/LDY before RTL. Note that `CODE_00913B` (which also does an MVN from bank `$08` to WRAM `$0540`) is **not** the universal fight-init — its only caller is gated by a P1+P2 button mask and reaches it only via the secret 2-player VS path.

Memory environment at the hook: DBR=`$0D` (set by upstream `LDA #DATA_0D8010>>16; PHA; PLB`), DP=`$2100` (from upstream `LDX #!REGISTER_ScreenDisplayRegister; PHX; PLD`), X is 16-bit, A is 8-bit. All WRAM access uses long addressing (`LDA.l`/`STA.l`) — direct-page would target PPU registers (`$2100+offset`) and absolute would target bank-`$0D` ROM.

**The cross-bank-RTS trap (portrait hooks):** `CODE_00EC6E` ends with intra-bank `RTS`, not `RTL`. JSL'ing it directly from bank `$0D` corrupts both the stack (RTS pops 2, JSL pushed 3) and PBR — RTS doesn't restore PBR, so the CPU resumes at `$00:<our_offset>` instead of `$0D:<our_offset>` after the call. The fix is a 5-byte trampoline at `$00:F5D0` (`JSR EC6E + RTL`): the sep-variant portrait stubs `JSL` the trampoline, the trampoline does an intra-bank `JSR` (RTS-balanced), then `RTL`s back to bank `$0D` cleanly.

The rts-variant portrait hook (site `$00:EC69`, originally `JSR EC6E + RTS`) has a different stack scenario: the original `RTS` was meant to return to a bank-`$00` caller of `CODE_00EC87`. The replacement stub lives in bank `$00` (`UNK_00F5D0+5`) so its closing RTS runs with PBR=`$00` and pops the bank-`$00` caller's return cleanly. The stub does `JSR EC6E` directly (intra-bank, balanced), runs the per-mode fixup, then `PLA PLA PLA` to drop our own JSL frame (PCL/PCH/PBR) before falling through to `RTS`.

**Per-frame portrait detection:** `CODE_00EC6E` reads from one of 11 source tables (`DATA_00ED03..DATA_00EDF3` for 9 brightness levels of rest, plus `DATA_00EE11` for blink frame A and `DATA_00EE2F` for blink frame B). The portrait stubs detect which frame the engine just loaded by re-reading `$7E:0538` after EC6E returns:

| `$0538` value | Frame | Frame offset into portrait table |
|---|---|---|
| `$0D4A` | blink A (powered-up frame 1) | 12 |
| `$14B1` | blink B (powered-up frame 2) | 24 |
| anything else | rest | 0 |

Then `table_offset = frame_offset + (mode-1)*4` indexes into the 36-byte portrait table at `$0D:FFAB` (3 modes × 3 frames × 4 bytes per entry, c12 word + c13 word).

**Mode flag at WRAM `$7E:1FE0`:** placed in high low-RAM rather than direct-page low-RAM because the fight engine clobbers `$00A8` and adjacent low-RAM addresses during gameplay via direct-page accesses (DP=`$0000` collides with absolute `$00A8`). `$7E:1FE0` is untouched by direct-page activity in the fight loop. Reseeded by Hook 1 every fight init — there is no persistent state across matches, so no back-out clear hook is needed.

**Free space consumed:**
- Bank `$0D`: 459 bytes used within `$0D:FDAA-$0D:FFCE`. Inside the disassembly's `%InsertGarbageData($0DFA69, ...)` zone.
- Bank `$00`: 74 bytes at `$00:F5D0-$00:F619`. Inside the disassembly's `UNK_00F5D0` `%InsertGarbageData` zone.
- File `0x05DF` (SNES `$00:85DF`): 8 bytes — `DATA_008547` (ColorEndScreen.bin) palette 4 c12-c15. In-place edit, no free space consumed.

### [`spo_profile_stats_fix.ips`](../patches/standalone/spo_profile_stats_fix.ips)

**What it does:** Corrects Mr. Sandman's profile screen (wrong stats copied from Super Macho Man) and Mad Clown's profile screen (weight listed as 390 lbs instead of 370 lbs).

After patching:
- Mr. Sandman: age 30, weight 270 lbs, record 28-4 (correct JP values, also confirmed in the game's manual)
- Mad Clown: weight 370 lbs

**Problem 1 — Sandman:** Mr. Sandman's profile data at file `0x42CD1` is a copy of Super Macho Man's record (`$08AC89`). A copy-paste error in the original source.

**Problem 2 — Mad Clown:** Mad Clown's weight at file `0x42CA5` is `0x19` ("9"), giving "390 lbs". The correct value is `0x17` ("7"), giving "370 lbs".

**Data format:** `[country][0A][age 2 digits][0A][weight 2 digits][0A][record][00]`
Font encoding: digits `0–9` = `$10–$19`, dash = `$F4`. Weight is stored as 2 digits; the renderer appends a literal "0" ("27" → "270 lbs").

**Sandman fix:** 10 bytes at file `0x42CD8`:
```
Old: 12 18 0A 12 13 0A 12 19 F4 13   ("28", "23", "29-3" — Macho's stats)
New: 13 10 0A 12 17 0A 12 18 F4 14   ("30", "27", "28-4" — correct JP values)
```

**Mad Clown fix:** 1 byte at file `0x42CA5`:
```
Old: 19   (digit "9" → 390 lbs)
New: 17   (digit "7" → 370 lbs)
```

### [`spo_super_macho_man_fix.ips`](../patches/standalone/spo_super_macho_man_fix.ips)

**What it does:** Fixes the original ROM's "SUPER MACHOMAN" → "SUPER MACHO MAN" typo across every screen in the game (Mode Select, opponent select, time-attack title card, Personal Records, BEST TIME table, pre-fight profile). The corrected spelling matches the US manual and every other appearance of the character — Punch-Out!! (1987, NES) and Punch-Out!! (2009, Wii).

**Background:** Super Macho Man is the only fighter whose two-word surname is collapsed in the original ROM — every other two-word boss name (MAD CLOWN, ARAN RYAN, BOB CHARLIE, etc.) is correctly spaced. The on-ROM "MACHOMAN" is a deliberate typo that ships in every region.

**Why Nintendo shipped the typo:** the layout system literally cannot fit "SUPER MACHO MAN" with the correct spacing on the pre-fight profile screen. That screen renders a header line of the form `<RANK> <FIGHTER NAME>` in a custom double-height font (1 column wide × 2 rows tall per letter). For champion fighters, `<RANK>` is `CHAMP.`, and the renderer auto-centers the whole line based on its visible length:

| Fighter         | Rank prefix | Total chars |
|---|---|---|
| MR. SANDMAN     | `CHAMP.`    | 6 + 1 + 10 = 17 |
| ARAN RYAN       | `CHAMP.`    | 6 + 1 + 9 = 16 |
| MAD CLOWN       | `CHAMP.`    | 6 + 1 + 9 = 16 |
| HEIKE KAGERO    | `CHAMP.`    | 6 + 1 + 12 = 19 |
| **SUPER MACHOMAN** (original) | `CHAMP.`    | 6 + 1 + 14 = **21** |
| **SUPER MACHO MAN** (corrected) | `CHAMP.`    | 6 + 1 + 15 = **22** |
| NICK BRUISER    | `CHAMP.`    | 6 + 1 + 12 = 19 |

The available horizontal layout slot is exactly 21 columns. With the correct "SUPER MACHO MAN" (15 chars), the line is 22 columns wide and overflows by one tile. Nintendo most likely solved this by collapsing "MACHO MAN" into "MACHOMAN" — exactly fitting the slot — and shipped that everywhere for consistency. This is the single hardest constraint in the patch.

**Why it took more than a one-byte string edit:** the boss name is rendered by **two different code paths** with different fonts and layouts, and extending the string from 14 → 15 chars overflows fixed layout slots on three of the four screen types. The fix combines a string redirect, three descriptor column tweaks, a banner-table redirect with a new entry in free space, and a per-fighter code patch so Macho Man's profile-screen portrait shifts +4 pixels right (giving the longer name room to fit) without affecting any other fighter's portrait.

**Two boss-name systems, two fonts:**

| System | Font | Used by | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Menu-font (1 tile per char) | A=`$0A`, …, Z=`$23`, space=`$EF` (renderer also column-skips on `$FF`, which we use here) | Mode Select, opponent-select, TA title card, Personal Records | DA332 entry `$30` (`$0D:AC85`) |
| Banner-font (1 col × 2 rows per char) | A=`$45`, B=`$46`, …, M=`$61`, S=`$67`, space=`$EF` (real tile, not a skip) | BEST TIME table, pre-fight profile screen | Per-fighter table at `$08:BB3D` |

(Note: the two renderers handle space-like bytes oppositely. In the menu font, `$EF` is the documented space tile while `$FF` is treated as a column-skip — both produce a visible space. In the banner font, `$EF` is a real tile that gets rendered. We use `$FF` in the new menu-font string at `$0D:FD69` for consistency with neighboring entries like MAD CLOWN, and `$EF` in the banner-font entry at `$08:D926` because that's what the banner renderer expects.)

**Banner-font letter map** (top tile values; bottom-half tile is always top + `$10`):

| Letter | Tile | Letter | Tile |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | `$45` | M | `$61` |
| B | `$46` | N | `$62` |
| C | `$47` | O | `$63` |
| D | `$48` | P | `$64` |
| E | `$49` | R | `$66` |
| H | `$4C` | S | `$67` |
| I | `$4D` | T | `$68` |
| K | `$4F` | U | `$69` |
| L | `$60` | W | `$6B` |
| (space) | `$EF` | Y | `$6D` |

**The four screens:**

| # | Screen | Font | Source data |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Mode Select / opponent-select / time-attack title card | menu | DA332 index `$30` |
| 2 | Personal Records (PR) | menu | DA332 index `$30`, drawn via descriptor at `$0D:AE91` |
| 3 | Opponent-select / TA two-line title (large) | menu | DA332 index `$30`, drawn via descriptor at `$0D:AF71` |
| 4 | BEST TIME table + pre-fight profile screen | banner | Per-fighter table at `$08:BB3D` |

Screens 1–3 share the same DA332 string entry, so they're all fixed by a single redirect (plus column tweaks for the layouts that don't fit the longer string). Screen 4 uses a completely separate data structure with its own font encoding and rendering routine, requiring a banner-table redirect plus a per-fighter code patch.

**Patch records:**

| File offset | Bytes | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `0x06A392` | `69 FD` | DA332 entry `$30` redirect → `$0D:FD69` (new "MACHO MAN" string) |
| `0x06FD69` | 10 B | New length-prefixed string `09 16 0A 0C 11 18 FF 16 0A 17` ("MACHO MAN" with `$FF` space) |
| `0x06AE8F` | `04` | PR descriptor: SUPER WRAM-lo `$5C06`→`$5C04` (col 3 → col 2) |
| `0x06AE93` | `10` | PR descriptor: MACHO MAN WRAM-lo `$5C12`→`$5C10` (col 9 → col 8) |
| `0x06AF73` | `28` | TA title card: MACHO MAN WRAM-lo `$542A`→`$5428` (col 21 → col 20) |
| `0x043B53` | `26 D9` | Banner-table pointer for fighter idx 11 → `$08:D926` |
| `0x045926` | 19 B | New banner entry: prefix `00 00 00`, name `S U P E R [space] M A C H O [space] M A N`, terminator |
| `0x0452AB` | 5 B | Hook in profile renderer: replace `LDX #$38A8; STX $7A` with `JSL $0D:FD87; NOP` |
| `0x06FD87` | 18 B | Per-fighter portrait X-shift stub at `$0D:FD87` |

**Per-fighter portrait stub (`$0D:FD87`):** the profile-screen renderer loads the portrait sprite's base position as a packed 16-bit `$38A8` (Y=`$38`, X=`$A8`) and stores it to `$7A`. Replacing that with a JSL to a stub lets us conditionally load `$38AC` (X+4 = half a tile column right) for fighter index 11 only. The 4-pixel shift creates room on the left side of Macho Man's portrait so the wider "CHAMP. SUPER MACHO MAN" line fits without overflowing the layout slot — every other fighter's portrait stays at its original position.

```asm
A5 00            LDA $00         ; fighter index
C9 0B            CMP #$0B        ; Macho Man?
F0 06            BEQ macho
A2 A8 38         LDX #$38A8      ; default Y/X
86 7A            STX $7A
6B               RTL
macho:
A2 AC 38         LDX #$38AC      ; Macho: +4 px right
86 7A            STX $7A
6B               RTL
```

**Why the PR descriptor needs both `$2F` and `$30` shifted (not just `$30`):** the original layout placed SUPER (5 chars) at col 3 and MACHOMAN (8 chars) at col 9, with a 1-column gap at col 8 — the rendered text ends exactly at col 16, the right edge of the layout slot. Naively shifting only the new 9-char "MACHO MAN" to col 8 fits within col 16 but eats the inter-word gap (the M of MACHO now sits at col 8), rendering as "SUPERMACHO MAN". Shifting both records left by one (SUPER c3→c2, MACHO MAN c9→c8) preserves the gap at col 7 and keeps the line centered cleanly within cols 2–16.

**Banner-table entry format** (`$08:BB3D` is a 16-pointer table; each entry has a 3-byte prefix):

```
[byte[0]: BEST-TIME / PR X-offset]
[byte[1]: profile-screen X-offset]
[byte[2]: post-CHAMP gap (in tile columns × 2)]
[name tile bytes... (banner-font encoding)]
[$00 terminator]
```

byte[0] is added (×2) to the X-base for the BEST TIME / PR renderer at `CODE_08D4AF` — lower = farther left. The new entry uses byte[0] = `$00` (vs the original `$01` for MACHOMAN), which anchors the now-15-char name 1 column further left to fit. PISTON HURRICANE (the only original 16-char name) also uses byte[0] = `$00`, confirming the convention.

**Why the portrait shift (rather than a text shift) on the profile screen:** the pre-fight profile renderer (`CODE_08D162`) reads byte[1] of the prefix and computes an X-base of `$61C2 + 2 × byte[1]` for the whole `<RANK> <FIGHTER NAME>` line, then draws the rank prefix (5 cols wide), advances X by 10 + `2 × byte[2]`, and finally draws the name. byte[1] and byte[2] are both already at their minimum value `$00` for our entry, and there's no banner-data byte that can shift only the name without also moving CHAMP. Shifting `$61C2` directly would move the whole line — including CHAMP. Instead, shifting the **portrait sprite** 4 pixels right (which has pixel-level granularity since it's OAM) creates room on the layout's left side for the wider name, leaving CHAMP. anchored at its original column. The corrected name fits without overflowing.

**Cosmetic side effect:** the portrait has a separate drop-shadow (drawn by code we never identified) that doesn't follow the +4 px shift, so on Macho Man's profile screen the portrait and its shadow are slightly offset. The mismatch is 4 pixels and only visible by side-by-side comparison with other fighters' profiles — accepted as a minor trade-off.

**Free-space allocations:** 19 B in bank `$08` at `$08:D926` (inside the disassembly's `%InsertGarbageData($08D926, ...)` zone — dead development-time data, never referenced at runtime), 10 B in bank `$0D` at `$0D:FD69` (new menu-font string), and 18 B in bank `$0D` at `$0D:FD87` (portrait stub). All inside disassembly-documented `%InsertGarbageData` regions — verified by ROM-wide JSL/JML/JSR/JMP search to be unreferenced.

### [`spo_how_to_typo_fix.ips`](../patches/standalone/spo_how_to_typo_fix.ips)

**What it does:** Fixes a single-letter typo in the in-game tutorial demo (the HOW-TO-PLAY attract sequence). The UPPERCUT lesson string in the original ROM reads *"Knock Out Punches can be highly **devestating**!"* — corrected to **devastating**.

**Data location:** the tutorial demo's text strings live in `DATA_08B83E` (SNES `$08:B83E`, file `0x4383E`) and use a custom run-length-style font encoding where each byte after a `$8X` length prefix is a single character tile index. The relevant 12-character segment encodes `devestating!`:

```
8C 1C 0A 3C 0A 24 08 10 08 1E 06 20 16
   d  e  v  e  s  t  a  t  i  n  g  !
```

`$8C` is the run length (12 chars); the bytes that follow are the per-character tile indices. In this encoding `e = $0A` and `a = $10`. The fix patches the 4th character byte from `$0A` (`e`) to `$10` (`a`).

**Patch record:** 1 byte at file `0x43876`:
```
Old: 0A   ('e')
New: 10   ('a')
```

### [`spo_title_screen_special_ring.ips`](../patches/standalone/spo_title_screen_special_ring.ips)

**What it does:** Replaces the title-screen ring logo and background color palette with the Special Circuit variants. The SUPER PUNCH-OUT!! logo is unchanged; only the ring artwork and colors behind and around it are swapped. All in-game circuit screens are unaffected — only the title screen is altered.

Redirects two sites in the title-screen frame handler `CODE_008EE4`:

| File offset | Old | New | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x0F25` | `02` | `08` | `LDX #$8002` → `LDX #$8008` — loads Special Circuit ring logo GFX instead of Minor Circuit |
| `0x0F68–0F6A` | `AE 18 80` | `A2 B6 99` | `LDX DATA_088000+$18` → `LDX #$99B6` — reads Special Circuit palette directly instead of via the pointer table, leaving the table entry (and all in-game Minor Circuit references) unchanged |

Bank `$0E` header table: `+$00` = MainMenu font, `+$02` = MinorCircuit, `+$04` = MajorCircuit, `+$06` = WorldCircuit, `+$08` = SpecialCircuit.

### [`spo_title_screen_special_logo.ips`](../patches/standalone/spo_title_screen_special_logo.ips)

**What it does:** Writes the text **SPECIAL EDITION** into the title screen's BG3 tilemap buffer at row 12, cols 6–22 (with a one-tile gap between SPECIAL and EDITION), using the standard menu font (palette 2, priority 1). Rendered every time the title screen BG init routine runs.

**Hook** (6 bytes at file `0x44906`, SNES `$08:C906`):

```

New: 22 DF FB 0D  EA EA   JSL $0D:FBDF / NOP / NOP
```

This is the 6 bytes immediately after the last `JSL CODE_08C433` call in `CODE_08C8AB` (the title screen BG init routine). The two displaced instructions are re-executed at the top of the stub.

**Stub** (109 bytes at `$0D:FBDF`, file `0x6FBDF`):

Tile entry format: `$28XX` = priority 1, palette 2, tile index XX. Font encoding: A–Z = `$0A–$23`. The space between words (col 13 = WRAM `$531A`) is left unwritten — the background fill tile at that position acts as the gap.

**BG3 tilemap address formula (title screen):**

```
WRAM = $5000 + row × 64 + col × 2
```

The `$5000` block is DMA'd to VRAM `$4C00` by `CODE_08C8AB`. Despite `BG3SC` (`$2109`) being set to `$59` (→ VRAM `$5800`) elsewhere in the title screen init, empirically the `$5000` block (→ VRAM `$4C00`) is the buffer that renders as BG3 and carries the menu font. Writing to the `$6000` block (→ VRAM `$5800`) lands on BG1 instead. The static register assignment in the disassembly (`$59` at file `0x43FD9`) does not fully describe the runtime BG assignment — see [section 10](#10-title-screen-bg-layout-quirk).

**Free space consumed:** `$0D:FBDF–$0D:FC4B` (109 bytes). Does not conflict with any other patch.

### [`spo_jp_charset_enabled.ips`](../patches/standalone/spo_jp_charset_enabled.ips)

**What it does:** Makes L/R cycling between three character sets (Japanese-1, Japanese-2, Western) always active in name entry, with no button combo required. The screen opens on the Western set by default, so players who don't want Japanese characters don't need to do anything differently. L and R cycle through all three sets as they do in the Japanese version.

The name-entry screen has a hidden mode where L/R cycles between three character sets (Japanese-1, Japanese-2, Western). Activated by holding X+A or Start+X+A at the New Game cursor. The JP version has it on by default.

Three single-byte changes at SNES `$01:DF83`/`$DF92`/`$DF95` (file `0xDF83–0xDF95`):

| File offset | Old | New | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0xDF83` | `F0` (BEQ) | `80` (BRA) | Always take the Japanese-mode-enabled branch |
| `0xDF92` | `9C` | `B7` | `JSR $D79C` → `JSR $D7B7` — load full Western UI tiles instead of just swapping the Japanese set (avoids corrupted tilemap on US ROM where Japanese-set UI tiles aren't pre-loaded) |
| `0xDF95` | `00` | `02` | Initial `$1F = $02` (Western set index, matching the `$D7B7` load) |

---

### [`spo_credits.ips`](../patches/standalone/spo_credits.ips)

**What it does:** Adds a fourth `CREDITS` entry to the **Records View select screen** (the screen that asks which circuit's records to view) and tightens the layout so the four entries sit at rows 10/14/18/22 with the header at row 2 — matching the Championship circuit-select layout. Selecting `CREDITS` launches the game's ending-cutscene credits roll. After the credits finish the game stays on the final screen and requires reset; that is the original cutscene's terminal behavior, not introduced by this patch.

Also folds in a **no-record artifact fix**: when the credits roll launches before all 16 opponents are beaten, fighters with no record would display a Japanese glyph tile in the `YOUR BEST` time slot. See the full breakdown below.

**Final on-screen layout:**

| Row | Element | Layer |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | RECORDS VIEW MODE | Layer 1 |
| 6 | `<` ITEM SELECT `>` | Layer 2 |
| 10 | BEST TIME | Layer 1 |
| 14 | BEST SCORE | Layer 1 |
| 18 | PERSONAL RECORDS | Layer 1 |
| 22 | CREDITS | Layer 1 |

**Records View screen architecture:**

The select screen's init at `CODE_01BFA2` (file `0x0BFA2`) runs a sequence of operations that *each* hardcode WRAM addresses paired to specific tile rows. Moving any element requires updating all of its paired hardcoded references in lockstep. The five coupled positions are:

| Init offset | Hardcoded value | Paired with |
|---|---|---|
| `0x0BFAB` (`$47`) | `$0310` | first entry row (highlight bar base) |
| `0x0BFDB` (`CBA8` X) | `$5A14` | subheader Layer 2 row (palette-cycle range) |
| `0x0BFE9` (`CB57` X) | `$00CE` | "RECORDS VIEW MODE" header row (palette cycle) |
| `0x0BFF2`/`0x0BFF5` (`D70C` X/Y) | `$0210`/`$022E` | subheader row (`<`/`>` brackets) |
| `0x0C022` (`$53` cursor anchor Y) | `$5F` | first entry row (cursor sprite scan start) |

**Why the cursor anchor is the load-bearing one — the `D082` scan loop:**

`CB57` (the palette-cycler called with `X=$0000, Y=$0200`) reads each tilemap entry, and for the empty-fill value `$0064` produces:

- `$00EF` written to the same position
- `$00FF` written to row+1 (shadow row)

Those are exactly the two sentinel values that `CODE_01D082` (the cursor's auto-snap-to-text scan) skips. After init the cursor sprite is positioned by:

1. Setting sprite Y to `$53 + 1` (`$5F + 1 = $60` = pixel row 12).
2. Calling `CAAE`, which loops calling `D082` — converts sprite (X,Y) to tilemap offset via `Y*8 + X/4`, reads the tile, advances X by 8 px and re-tries if the tile is `$EF`/`$FF`, exits when it finds real text.

If `BEST TIME` is anywhere other than row 12, the scan finds only the CB57-transformed `$EF`/`$FF` sentinels at row 12 and **loops forever** — the audio CPU keeps running (music plays) but the main CPU is stuck. The fix is to shift `$53` (file `0x0C022`) in lockstep with the first entry's row.

**Patch records:**

| File offset | Bytes | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `0x0BFA6` | `03` | `$14=3` (4-item highlight loop, was 3) |
| `0x0BFAB` | `90 02` | `$47=$0290` highlight bar base (row 12 → row 10) |
| `0x0BFDB` | `94 59` | `CBA8` palette-cycle base `$5A14` → `$5994` (subhdr row 8 → 6) |
| `0x0BFE9` | `8E` | second `CB57` X arg `$00CE` → `$008E` (cycle row 2, not row 3) |
| `0x0BFF2` | `90 01` | arrow renderer X `$0210` → `$0190` (`<` row 8 → 6) |
| `0x0BFF5` | `AE 01` | arrow renderer Y `$022E` → `$01AE` (`>` row 8 → 6) |
| `0x0C022` | `4F` | cursor sprite anchor Y `$5F` → `$4F` (scan starts at row 10) |
| `0x0C9CA` | `5C 39 FB 0D` | `JML $0D:FB39` — replaces start of `CODE_01C9CA`, bypasses original 3-way dispatch |
| `0x6A3EC` | `0C FB` | `DA3DA[$12]` redirect to `$0D:FB0C` (replaces ptr to `$AE3F`) |
| `0x6A47A` | `31 FB` | `DA332[$A4]` redirect to `$0D:FB31` (CREDITS tile string) |
| `0x6AE62` | `8E` | descriptor `$14` RECORDS WRAM lo `$50CE` → `$508E` (row 3 → 2) |

| `0x6AE6A` | `AC` | descriptor `$14` MODE WRAM lo `$50EC` → `$50AC` |
| `0x6FB0C` | 37 B | new screen descriptor (9 records + terminator) |
| `0x6FB31` | 8 B | "CREDITS" tile string (`07 0C 1B 0E 0D 12 1D 1C`) |

The text-index `$A4` (`DA332[$A4]`) is repurposed: in the original ROM it pointed to garbage at `$B0A7` that is never used as menu text.

**A-button dispatch stub (`$0D:FB39`, 41 bytes):**

The original `CODE_01C9CA` is the confirm dispatcher for state `$05=0`, `$07=8` on this screen. It advances `$05` by 2/4/6 based on `$07E6` (cursor index 0/1/2) to enter the score-display state for Minor/Major/World circuits. Index 3 (CREDITS) is not handled by the original code — it falls through to index 2's path. The stub replaces that dispatch wholesale by JMLing into bank `$0D` from the very first byte of `C9CA`, implementing all four cases plus the original `$44 != 0` short-circuit:

```asm
A5 44              LDA $44
D0 21              BNE +$21         ; → JML $01:C94F (the $44 ≠ 0 path)
AD E6 07           LDA $07E6
F0 10              BEQ +$10         ; → index 0 INC pair
C9 01              CMP #$01
F0 08              BEQ +$08         ; → index 1 INC pair
C9 03              CMP #$03
F0 10              BEQ +$10         ; → index 3 JML
E6 05  E6 05       INC $05 ×2       ; index 2 fall-through (3 INC pairs total)
E6 05  E6 05       INC $05 ×2       ; index 1 enters here  (2 INC pairs total)
E6 05  E6 05       INC $05 ×2       ; index 0 enters here  (1 INC pair total)
64 07              STZ $07
AB                 PLB
6B                 RTL
5C 9C B2 00        JML $00:B29C     ; index 3: ending-cutscene credits roll
5C 4F C9 01        JML $01:C94F     ; $44 ≠ 0 path
```

**Free space consumed:** `$0D:FB0C–$0D:FB61` (86 bytes) and `$01:FEC2–$01:FED3` (18 bytes). Conflicts with `spo_sound_mode_ui_incomplete.ips`, which also uses `$0D:FB0C+` — the two patches cannot be applied together.

**No-record artifact — root cause and fix:**

The credits roll animation engine in bank `$01` runs a per-frame state machine (`CODE_01DA7C`). On each frame, state-index 1 dispatches to `CODE_01DAC4`, which redraws the `YOUR BEST` time tile block for the current fighter onto BG3. The key section:

```asm
CODE_01DAC4:
    JSR CODE_01DB4C        ; blank tilemap region
    ...
    LDA.w $0608            ; fighter SRAM slot index (signed)
    BPL CODE_01DB21        ; >= 0: fighter has a record path
    ; else: no-record hardcoded tile path
    LDA #$03
    STA.l $7E40B0          ; hardcoded tile for the leading slot
    ...
    BRA CODE_01DB2A

CODE_01DB21:               ; "has record" path
    LDX #$40B0
    STX $00DA              ; destination base = $7E40B0
    JSR CODE_01D52B        ; read SRAM, write digit tiles to $7E40B0+
```

`CODE_01D52B` computes a fighter-specific SRAM offset (`$0600` × 5), reads 5 consecutive bytes from SRAM bank `$70`, and writes them as digit tiles to `$7E40B0` onward:

```asm
CODE_01D558:
    ...
    LDA.l $700006,x        ; SRAM byte at offset+6 → $7E40B0
    LDX $00DA
    STA.l $7E0000,x        ; = STA.l $7E40B0  ← artifact slot
```

`$7E40B0` is in BG3's per-frame tilemap buffer; a per-frame DMA copies `$7E4000–$7E47FF` to VRAM `$7000`. VRAM `$7058` = WRAM `$7E40B0` (offset `$B0` / 2 = word `$58`). The credits font maps tile `$FF` to a Japanese glyph.

**Why the BPL is always taken via our menu path:** `$0608` is initialized to `$00` by `CODE_00913B` (called during credits init at `CODE_00B2A3`) and is never updated per-fighter when launching via our `JML $00:B29C` path. `$0608 = 0` (non-negative) means BPL is always taken — so `CODE_01D52B` runs for every fighter, including unbeaten ones whose SRAM is uninitialized (`$FF`).

**Fix:** replace the 3-byte `JSR CODE_01D52B` at `$01:DB27` (file `0x0DB27`) with `JSR $FEC2`. The 18-byte stub at `$01:FEC2` (file `0x0FEC2`, in the 206-byte garbage zone `UNK_01FEC2`):

```asm
20 2B D5        JSR CODE_01D52B   ; call original — writes SRAM data to $7E40B0
AF B0 40 7E     LDA.l $7E40B0     ; read the written tile
C9 FF           CMP #$FF          ; is it the bad glyph?
D0 06           BNE +6            ; no: leave it, go to RTS
A9 03           LDA #$03          ; yes: tile $03 = digit "3" - Nintendo's own no-record placeholder, leading digit of 3'00"00 (full round duration)
8F B0 40 7E     STA.l $7E40B0     ; overwrite
60              RTS               ; return to CODE_01DB2A epilog
```

Uses `LDA.l` / `STA.l` (24-bit addressing) so DBR is irrelevant. The check fires once per fighter per frame but the condition is only true for unbeaten fighters — beaten fighters' SRAM holds valid digit tiles (`$00`–`$09`), never `$FF`.

**Why `$01:FEC2`:** the 206-byte block at `$01:FEC2–$01:FF8F` is labeled `UNK_01FEC2` in the disassembly (a copy of `$00:FEC2`, never executed at runtime — confirmed by ROM-wide JSR/JMP/BRA search). It is the largest free zone in bank `$01` and sits entirely before the interrupt-vector table at `$01:FF90`.

### [`spo_disable_security_checksum.ips`](../patches/standalone/spo_disable_security_checksum.ips)

The World Circuit completion checksum prevents the Special Circuit from unlocking when using save states, emulators (SNES Classic, Switch NSO), or patched ROMs. This patch disables that checksum check. Identical to patch record [1] in the Versus Hack, plus a 3-byte SNES-header checksum fix-up at file `0x7FDC`.

### [`spo_sound_mode_ui_incomplete.ips`](../patches/incomplete/spo_sound_mode_ui_incomplete.ips)

**What it does:** Adds a SOUND MODE entry to the title-screen menu and shifts the entire menu UI up by 4 rows to accommodate it. The menu now shows NEW GAME / CONTINUE / DATA / CLEAR / SOUND MODE across rows 9/13/17/17/21. Cursor highlight, OAM sprite, arrows, and the MENU/<<SELECT decoration header all shift consistently.

**Known bugs:** (1) Pressing A on SOUND MODE falls through to the DATA CLEAR handler — no A-button dispatch case has been wired for cursor index 3, and wiring the sound library entry requires a runtime trace to identify its trigger mechanism (it sits outside the normal title-screen state machine and requires a different VRAM tileset). (2) After selecting NEW GAME or CONTINUE, moving the cursor in the name entry screen causes a CPU deadlock. Root cause: adding a 4th title-screen item requires `$14=3` (the highlight renderer loops items 0–3); this value persists in WRAM and `CODE_01CAEA` (name-entry cursor navigation) reads `DP+$20+x` as disable flags in a loop — with `$14=3` still set, `CC79` over-iterates into an out-of-bounds layout entry, corrupting memory and freezing on the next cursor movement. This patch is a proof-of-concept only, is **not** included in `spo_special_edition_v1.6.ips`, and is not recommended for general use.

**Why JSL instead of JSR:** The original `JSR $CA71` (3 bytes) is replaced with `JSL $0D:FB2D` (4 bytes) to reach the stub in bank `$0D` without needing any bank `$01` relay stub. Bank `$01` has zero confirmed-free bytes remaining. The JSL's 4th byte (`$0D`) overwrites `$B197` — the opcode of the following `LDX #$0002`. The stub compensates by inlining that `LDX` before `RTL`, and `$B198–$B199` are patched to `NOP NOP` as a safe landing pad after `RTL`.

**Why the stub inlines `CODE_01CA71`:** The original `JSR $CA71` not only triggered our `STZ $23` but also ran `CODE_01CA71`, which initializes the highlight system (`$74` = D0 base, `$49` = step size, `$12`/`$0C`/`$0E`). Replacing the JSR with JSL to a stub that only did `STZ $23; LDX; RTL` skipped `CA71` entirely, leaving those variables uninitialized — the highlight bars rendered at garbage positions. The fix is to inline `CA71`'s body into the stub before the `LDX`/`RTL`.

## 7. Free space map

### Bank `$00` (file `0x0000–0x7FFF`)

The disassembly labels `$00:F5D0–$00:FF8F` as `UNK_00F5D0` — a 2,496-byte `%InsertGarbageData` region, never referenced by any JSL/JSR/JMP/JML in the ROM (verified by ROM-wide search). `spo_alt_glove_colors.ips` is the first patch in this repo to consume bytes here.

| Range | Size | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `0x75D0–0x75D4` | 5 B | EC6E trampoline (`spo_alt_glove_colors.ips` portrait sep stubs) |
| `0x75D5–0x7619` | 69 B | Portrait stub-rts (`spo_alt_glove_colors.ips`) |
| `0x761A–0x7F8F` | 2,422 B | **Free** |

> Other regions in bank `$00` that look free are NOT safe — `0x0D03`, `0x0D25`, `0x0D42` are runs of `$FF` inside `DATA_008CC1` / `DATA_008CE5` (kanji/tile data tables); `0x202A` is zero-padding inside `DATA_00A004` (PPU register init table); `0x636B` is zero-padding inside `DATA_00E365` (indexed jump table). All would corrupt game data if patched.

### Bank `$01` (file `0x8000–0xFFFF`)

**Zero confirmed-free bytes remain** in bank `$01`.

| Range | Size | Status |

| Bank `$00` (`UNK_00F5D0`) | **2,422 B** |

`spo_super_macho_man_fix.ips` also consumes 19 bytes in bank `$08` at file `0x045926` (`$08:D926`) for the new fighter-banner entry. That region sits inside the disassembly's documented `%InsertGarbageData($08D926, ...)` zone — dead code from development, never referenced at runtime.

> The same `$0D:FB0C–$0D:FB4B` range is also written by `spo_sound_mode_ui_incomplete.ips` (64 B for the title-screen sound-mode layout table + stub). These two patches **cannot be applied together** — they are mutually exclusive layouts of the same free space.

## 8. Text encoding and screen descriptor system

### Font encoding (menus and profile screens)

Used by the menu text renderer for Mode Select, opponent-select, etc.:

```
0–9   → $00–$09
A–Z   → $0A–$23  (A=$0A, B=$0B, …, Z=$23)
space → $EF      (in menu font; $64 renders as a Japanese glyph in this context)
```

### Text string format (`DATA_0DA332`)

Each entry: `[length_byte][tile_byte × length]`. The renderer reads `data[0]` as the character count — it does **not** use the gap to the next pointer entry. Do not update the next pointer when adding a new string.

### Key DA332 indices

| Index | Content | File offset of tile data |
|---|---|---|
| `$05` | `  SELECT` (2 leading `$EF` spaces + SELECT) | original |
| `$07` | MINOR | original |
| `$08` | MAJOR | original |
| `$09` | WORLD | original |
| `$0A` | SPECIAL | original |
| `$0B` | CIRCUIT | original |
| `$0C` | MODE | original |
| `$0D` | CHAMPIONSHIP | original |
| `$0F` | TIME | original |
| `$10` | RECORDS | original |
| `$11` | BUTTON | original |
| `$12` | ATTACK | original |
| `$13` | SETTING | original |
| `$0E` | VIEW | original |
| `$38` | space (1 tile, `$EF`) | original — **do not touch pointer**; used as spacer throughout |
| `$49` | PLAYER | original |
| `$2D` | PLAYER 2 (8 tiles) | `0x6FB03` — **repurposed** |
| `$30` | MACHO MAN (9 tiles) | `0x6FD69` — **redirected by `spo_super_macho_man_fix.ips`** (originally pointed at `$0D:AC85` "MACHOMAN" 8 tiles, the typo is reversed by repointing to a new 9-tile entry in free space) |
| `$37` | VERSUS (6 tiles) | `0x6FAC3` — **repurposed** |
| `$A4` | CREDITS (7 tiles) | `0x6FB31` — **repurposed by `spo_credits.ips`** (originally pointed to garbage at `$B0A7`, never used as menu text) |

**Warning:** `text_idx=$00` is the descriptor terminator sentinel. It cannot be used as a live token index — the renderer stops on it.

### Screen descriptor table (`DATA_0DA3DA`)

2-byte LE bank-relative pointers, one per screen/context. The renderer (`CODE_01D1FC`) is called with a **byte offset** into this table — so an arg of `$0E` means "the entry at byte offset `$0E`", i.e. the 8th pointer (index 7).

Key entries used or modified by this hack:

| Byte offset | Entry index | Pointer (default) | Screen / context |
|---|---|---|---|
| `$00` | 0 | `$AD48` | title screen layout |
| `$04` | 2 | `$AD6A` | Mode Select layout (redirected to `$FA86` by `spo_versus_hack.ips`) |
| `$12` | 9 | `$AE3F` | Records View select layout (redirected to `$FB0C` by `spo_credits.ips`) |
| `$14` | 10 | `$AE60` | "RECORDS VIEW MODE" header (modified in place by `spo_credits.ips`) |
| `$A4` | 82 | `$AEB7` (stale) | VERSUS opponent-select layout (redirected to `$FACA` by `spo_versus_hack.ips`) |

The opponent-select call site at `CODE_01BD0D` (file `0x0BD0D`) uses `TYA` to derive the argument from Y, where `Y=$000C` (Special Circuit complete) or `Y=$000E` (otherwise), selecting between byte-offset entries 6 and 7.

## 10. Title screen BG layout quirk

`CODE_08C8AB` (the title screen BG init, SNES `$08:C8AB`) runs two DMA transfers:

| Source WRAM | VRAM destination | Expected BG (from `$2109`) |
|---|---|---|
| `$5000–$57FF` | `$4C00` | — |
| `$6000–$67FF` | `$5800` | BG3 (`BG3SC = $59`) |

`$2109` (BG3SC) is set to `$59` (→ VRAM `$5800`) at file `0x43FD9`. The natural reading is that the `$6000` block renders as BG3 and `$5000` as something else. **This is wrong in practice.**

Empirically, writing menu font tiles (`$28XX`, palette 2) to the `$6000` block renders them on BG1; writing to the `$5000` block renders them on BG3 with the correct font. The `$5000` block (→ VRAM `$4C00`) is the tilemap that carries the menu character set and shows as BG3 on the title screen.

The likely explanation is that BG1SC (`$2107`) is also set to `$59` (→ VRAM `$5800`) by the NMI/VBLANK handler's PPU register upload — which copies configuration tables to hardware every frame and is not captured by the single explicit `STA $2109` in the static disassembly. Both BG1 and BG3 would then share VRAM `$5800` as their tilemap, but with different character data (CHR) base addresses: BG3's CHR contains the ring artwork, BG1's CHR contains the menu font. Writing to VRAM `$5800` (via the `$6000` WRAM buffer) renders as BG1 because BG1 has priority and its CHR has the letter glyphs at those tile indices; BG3 at the same tilemap renders ring-art tiles at those indices. Writing to VRAM `$4C00` (via the `$5000` buffer) hits BG3's exclusive tilemap where the font CHR applies.

**Practical rule for anyone continuing this work:** to write visible text on the title screen using the menu font, target the `$5000` WRAM buffer. WRAM address formula:

```
WRAM = $5000 + row × 64 + col × 2
```

The `$6000` buffer is the ring artwork layer (BG1 with ring CHR); modifying it affects the ring floor graphics, not text.
